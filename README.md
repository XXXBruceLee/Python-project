# Final Project: GDP Forecasting Model Based on Data from Three East Asian Countries

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project analyzes economic indicators such as **GDP, Household Consumption, Government Spending, Exports, and Imports** for three countries: **China (CHN), South Korea (KOR), and Japan (JPN)**.

The data is retrieved from the **World Bank API (WBGAPI)** and processed using **Python**.  
It allows for insights into economic trends over time, helping users visualize key indicators from **1970 to 2022**.

To predict future GDP trends, we use the **ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model**, a widely used statistical model for time series forecasting. By applying ARIMA to historical GDP data, we can generate reliable forecasts and observe economic patterns over time.


## ðŸ›  Technologies Used
- **Python 3.x**
- **Pandas & NumPy** (Data manipulation)
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (Data visualization)
- **WBGAPI** (World Bank API for economic data)


## ðŸ“Š Dataset Information
The project collects data for the following indicators:

- GDP (Gross Domestic Product)
- Household Consumption
- Gross Investment
- Government Spending
- Exports
- Imports

The dataset spans from 1970 to 2022, with yearly data for China, South Korea, and Japan.


## ðŸ“ˆ Example Visualization
This project provides visualizations to explore economic trends:

### - GDP Trend Over Years

  This visualization represents the **GDP growth trends** of China, Japan, and South Korea over time. By analyzing these trends, we can briefly compare the economic growth patterns of each country and identify major economic shifts, such as rapid growth or recessions.


### - GDP Composition Breakdown Over Time

  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cae57939-cff8-4433-b201-66cc542b5d21" alt="GDP Composition" width="800"/>

  This visualization illustrates how the **composition of GDP** (household consumption, investment, government spending, exports, and imports)  
has changed over time. By analyzing these proportions, we can observe how the share of consumption, investment, exports, etc., has changed over time and compare the **economic structures** of different countries.

  
### - Trends in GDP Composition Over Time for Each Country

  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/15d05492-a9ac-481f-b38f-edeec3ae7781" alt="GDP Composition Trend" width="800"/>

  Unlike the previous chart, this line graph highlights **how these GDP components evolve over time**. It allows us to analyze **long-term economic transformations** and detect shifts in economic strategy.


### - GDP Composition Comparison Across Countries

  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/69892e95-5281-423f-9f36-a7a323f83d1a" alt="GDP Composition Comparison" width="800"/>

  This bar chart compares the **average proportion of GDP components** for **China, Japan, and South Korea**. By analyzing these differences, we can can determine whether a countryâ€™s economy is **consumption-driven, investment-driven, or export-driven*  and compare **government spending, investment, and trade dependency** across nations. This visualization provides insights into the **structural differences between the economies** of these three East Asian nations.
